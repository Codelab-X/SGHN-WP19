# Overview
Wave energy refers to the kinetic energy carried by ocean waves, which can be harnessed and converted into electricity through various technologies. Understanding wave energy patterns is crucial for the efficient design and operation of wave energy converters (WECs) and for assessing the feasibility of wave energy projects.

This dataset provides a collection of floating point absorber (FPA) wave energy measurements recorded from 2019-01-01 00:00 to 2019-12-31 23:30. It includes various variables including peak wave period, significant wave height, maximum wave height, mean wave direction, wind speed etc.

# Data Description
The dataset comprises structured data in CSV format, with each row representing a single measurement or observation. Key attributes included in the dataset may include:

- Timestamp: Date and time of the measurement.
- Peak Wave Period (Tp): The period of the highest waves in a wave spectrum.
- Significant Wave Height (Hm0): The average height of the highest one-third of waves in a wave record.
- Significant Wave Height at 1/10 Probability (H1/10): The average height of the highest one-tenth of waves in a wave record.
- Maximum Wave Height (Hmax): The highest individual wave height observed.
- Mean Wave Direction (Dir): The average direction from which waves are coming.
- Wind Speed at 10m (WS): The wind speed measured at a height of 10 meters above the sea surface.
  
Additional metadata or derived features may also be included, depending on the specific dataset version and source.

# Potential Applications
This dataset can be used for a variety of applications, including but not limited to:

- Predictive Modeling: Developing machine learning or statistical models to predict wave energy patterns based on historical data.
- Resource Assessment: Assessing the potential wave energy resources in a particular region for renewable energy projects.
- Wave Energy Converter Design: Informing the design and optimization of wave energy converters for maximum efficiency.
- Environmental Impact Studies: Studying the environmental impact of wave energy extraction on marine ecosystems.
